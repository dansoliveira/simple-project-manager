# Simple Project Manager API

Very simple API to manage projects with tasks, developed on [first challenge](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-01/blob/master/README.md#desafio-01-conceitos-do-nodejs) at **[Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) Bootcamp GoStack 8.0** :rocket:.
This application will be used for personal learning, where I'll apply concepts acquired during GoStack.

## Features
### Current

  - all projects;
